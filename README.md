## Introduction
Fluentness is intended to be what JavaEE never was: an easy-to-learn, fully-integrated, consistent web framework. 

## Decalogue

>**F**orce your code to be compact, yet legible  
>**L**oose coupling by using onion-like software layers  
>**U**se flow class attributes as finished components and functions as helpers    
>**E**mbrace the consumer-provider architecture  
>**N**otice how unit tests may help you discover where the software design lacks    
>**T**ry to avoid comments and annotations  
>**N**ame each component as if it were your child  
>**E**ndorse convention over configuration  
>**S**plit your application in base, data and flow: the Fluentness way  
>**S**tart looking for singleton alternatives like injecting dependencies   

## Quickstart

### 1. Clone this repository :arrow_down:
into your working directory

```bash
git clone https://github.com/germede/Fluentness
```

### 2. Compile and install the sources :desktop_computer:
into your local Maven repository

```bash
cd Fluentness
mvn clean install
```

### 3. Bootstrap your application :rocket:

Navigate to your project root directory and execute following:
```bash
mvn archetype:generate                                  \
  -DarchetypeGroupId=org.fluentness                     \
  -DarchetypeArtifactId=archetype                       \
  -DarchetypeVersion=LATEST                             \
  -DgroupId=your.group.id                               \
  -DartifactId=your.artifact.id                         \
  -Dversion=0.0.1
```
Hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> when confirmation needed.  
In this guide we'll be using IntelliJ IDE Community Edition.  
Open the recently created project with your IDE.  
Enable Auto-Import when asked for.  
Open the DummyApp.java bootstrapper class and click on 'Run'.  
Under "Run Configurations", set "server:start" as program argument. Run again. 

### 4. Read the docs :closed_book:
Alternatively there is the directory /sample. This sample project is used for functional testing, but you can use it as base project instead of generating archetype.

Read in the [project's wiki](https://github.com/germede/Fluentness/wiki) how the sample Fluentness-based application "SongLibrary" was developed. Fluentness is intended to be easy to learn 
for newbies, but some documentation is always needed.   

### 5. Have fun and contribute :construction_worker:
Feel free to [open a new issue](https://github.com/germede/Fluentness/issues/new) directly on GitHub. Pull requests into the develop branch are also welcome. 
Please take the license limitations into account when using or modifying this project.
